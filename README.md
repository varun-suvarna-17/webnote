DESCRIPTION!!.....


I_ have created a webpage called Webnote, which serves as a demo webpage. While it doesn’t yet support writing, editing, or deleting files, key buttons such as "Go to Workspace", "Features Provided", and the navigation bar links are fully functional. However, I haven’t been able to implement the "New Folder" button yet.

This project was built using Figma for design and HTML for structure, where I converted the Figma designs into CSS code to bring the styling to life.
